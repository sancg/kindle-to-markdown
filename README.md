## Usage/Examples

All you need is to copy and past the `My Clipping.txt` file into the `./data` folder of the project.
You can config the route of the Clipping file on `./utils/Routes.js`

```js
const path = require('path');

const Routes = {
  root: path.dirname(__dirname),
  source: `${path.dirname(__dirname)}/src`,
  tempFile: `${path.dirname(__dirname)}/src/checkLastEntry.json`,
  clippingFile: path.join(path.dirname(__dirname), 'data', 'My Clippings.txt') // Add your Own clipping Route
};

module.exports = Routes;
```

After that run the command.

```bash
npm start
```
